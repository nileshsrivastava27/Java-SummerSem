//N-Grows only green apples
//S-Grows only red apples
//E-Some green apples
//W-Some red apples
//Approach:  Every apple in the south ensures that it is red. So first, take an apple from the south. In the East and West,
// there is at least 1 red apple in each tree. Thatâ€™s why, for guaranteed it is considered that there is only 1 red apple on each tree in east and west.
// For the north there is no red apple, so, neglect that. Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
//
//        If M is less than equal to S*K then print M.
//        Else if M is less than equal to S*K+E+W then print S*K + (M-S*K) * K
//        Else print -1.
